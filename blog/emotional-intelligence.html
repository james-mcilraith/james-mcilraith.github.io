      <h2>Emotional intelligence exploration</h2>
      <h4>Monday, 09 September 2024</h4>
      <h5>What is emotional intelligence?</h5>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to recognise, understand, and
        manage emotions in ourselves and others.
      </p>
      <p>One of the academic pioneers of EI described it this way:</p>
      <div>
        <blockquote
          cite="https://globalleadershipfoundation.com/deepening-understanding/emotional-intelligence"
        >
          <p>
            …emotional-social intelligence is an array of interrelated emotional
            and social competencies and skills that determine how effectively
            individuals understand and express themselves, understand others and
            relate with them, and cope with daily demands, challenges and
            pressures.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>- Reuven Bar-On, 2010</p></blockquote>
      </div>

      <p>
        EI can affect your physical health, mental health, relationships, social
        intelligence, and work performance. EI is most often defined by four
        attributes:
      </p>

      <ul class="list" style="list-style: circle">
        <li>
          <b>Self-awareness:</b> Helps you recognise and understand your
          emotions in the moment. Having a connection with your changing
          emotional experience is critical to understanding how emotions
          influence your actions and thoughts. To build self-awareness you need
          to connect with your core emotions, accept them, and be comfortable
          with them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Self-management:</b> Is about making constructive decisions about
          your behavior. By staying emotionally present you can get upsetting
          information and not let it override your thoughts and self-control.
          Rather, allowing you to manage your emotions in healthy ways, take the
          initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing
          circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Social awareness:</b> The core skill in social awareness is
          empathy. Knowing what people are feeling and thinking without them
          telling you in words. Social awareness requires your presence in the
          moment. Attending to this focus on others also helps you gain deeper
          insight on your own emotional being, including your values and
          beliefs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Relationship management:</b> Having excellent relationship skills
          is a central characteristic of good EI. This includes having social
          awareness of others and what they are experiencing. This helps make
          relationships more effective, fulfilling, and productive. Many experts
          believe EI is strong determiner of life success.
        </li>
      </ul>

      </p>

      <h5>How is EQ different to IQ?</h5>
      <p>
        Intelligence quotient (IQ) is designed to assess human intelligence. It
        is based on a series of standardized tests that measure aspects of human
        intelligence such as verbal comprehension, reasoning ability, and
        working memory. Modern IQ tests transform raw scores into a normal
        distribution with a mean (average) score of 100.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional quotient (EQ) is another name for the discussed emotional
        intelligence (EI). As noted, it conversely describes someone’s ability
        to recognise, understand, and manage emotions in ourselves and others.
        IQ is an older concept than EQ/EI. There are various ways to try and
        measure EQ/EI.
      </p>

      <h5>Why is EQ important?</h5>
      <p>
        There is good evidence that having a good EI supports workplace
        performance and life success. More so than IQ. Although this can depend
        somewhat on the context and how success is defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individuals with good EI can for example navigate social complexities,
        build strong relationships, and make broadly thoughtful decisions i.e.,
        account for the emotional and rational. EI contributes to improved
        communication, conflict resolution, and overall wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>As the noted EI author Daniel Goleman said:</p>

      <div>
        <blockquote
          cite="https://www.inc-aus.com/marcel-schwantes/3-ways-to-quickly-improve-your-emotional-intelligence.html"
        >
          <p>
            If your emotional abilities aren’t in hand, if you don’t have
            self-awareness, if you are not able to manage your distressing
            emotions, if you can’t have empathy and have effective
            relationships, then no matter how smart you are, you are not going
            to get very far.
          </p>

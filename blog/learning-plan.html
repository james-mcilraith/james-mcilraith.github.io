        <h2>My learning plan (2nd edition)</h2>
        <h4>Saturday, 28 September 2024</h4>

        <p>
          My new learning plan (2nd edition) – looks at some new supplementary
          learning plan aspects as Foundations comes to a close.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <i>
            What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course
            for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy?
            Do you have a destination in mind?
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to having a long-standing interest in wanting to do the
          course, I mentioned in my earlier learning plan that the course opens
          up some new possibilities for me. Building my software development
          know-how alongside other transferable knowledge and skills from the
          course. And that would feed into and support my social research mahi
          in new and exciting ways. While the thinking is still a little fuzzy,
          I am looking forward to utilising the knowledge and skills that I gain
          to make an impact in the social research field. To be discovered
          (TBD)!
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
            Bootcamp?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <i>
            Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your
            idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered
            any new ones during this course? How do you think these will
            help/hinder you during Bootcamp?
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a keen and steady learner, especially when I am interested in and
          passionate about a subject. I have reasonably good ‘learning
          processes’, such as reading, note-taking, and time-management skills.
          Learning limitations might include software development currency,
          being side-tracked following up on subjects or by other tasks, and the
          busyness of everyday life. I would add that the tyranny of distance
          (from Ōtaki to Wellington) may also prove to be a learning limitation
          i.e., with the tiredness of commutes.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I remain a keen and steady learner. And have found myself challenged
          and excited by the Foundations learning. My learning processes have
          been reasonably sound. However, I think my biggest concern, perhaps as
          with others, is the forthcoming Bootcamp’s speed and whether I will be
          able to keep pace with others or the course, when I have quite an
          entrenched measured learning style. That learning style is certainly
          advantageous at times; however, may not suit the more agile sprint
          format. Or, it may be fine. I remain optimistic.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
            will be?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <i>
            While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is
            not what we would like you to consider in this plan. Non-technical
            challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in
            groups, speaking in front of the group, keeping focused for nine
            weeks, etc.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Building on what was just mentioned, the biggest non-technical
          challenge I foresee is most probably pair programming or group work.
          While I welcome the challenge, and the importance of Tuakana-Teina
          roles, my own pattern of knowledge and skills acquisition tends to be
          quite independent (at least initially and until I gain a level of
          proficiency). Where there is pair programming or group work, my
          learning style pace may be different, and the ‘fast-slow’ of project
          work may be impacted. It is something that I will remain mindful of
          (as will my ego).
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <i>
            At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and
            improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are
            some areas for development you would like to work on?
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            For example, this could be communication, teamwork within groups,
            pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some
            leadership skills, or improving your self-awareness and reflective
            skills.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am looking forward to working with others – specifically
          collaborating using the workflows and processes seen in software
          development. This is a reasonably new way of working for me. And a
          different and interesting way of getting things done efficiently and
          effectively for software development purposes. And simply engaging
          with others and using all the skills mentioned is always helpful.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <i>
            What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be
            the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is helpful to
            voice these expectations.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          My expectations are related to having clear learning (guidance and
          processes) and learning outcomes (expectations). That these are
          provided and appropriate support is given to achieve those learning
          outcomes. And that ultimately I finish the course following a positive
          learning experience having achieved the learning outcomes. Noting that
          this relies on me, too!
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <i>
            Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek
            help in a timely way?
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am based in the Roa2024 hybrid group. And have been learning where
          to get help online and through Discord over these past few weeks. I
          think the in-person catch ups will be helpful. And suit my learning
          style i.e., bringing my human or technical challenges for a regular
          meeting to go over them. Noting also, as above, that achieving my
          learning outcomes is reliant on me putting in the mahi and learning
          the course material. That’s what I will be focused on and ensuring
          that I have the right supports and structures in place.

        <p>
          I am reasonably established in my long term goal or career pathway –
          as a social researcher working in government for the past decade. That
          is certainly something that I will be looking to build upon, in due
          course. This Dev Academy course opens up some new possibilities for me
          – to build my software development know-how alongside other
          transferable knowledge and skills from the course. That will hopefully
          support me to grow my social research career and also chart new
          directions in the software development field.

        <p>
          I am a keen and steady learner, especially when I am interested in and

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I think in non-technical / human skills, I am looking forward to
          working with others in the collaborative software space. Though it may
          prove challenging at times. The particular form that such
          collaboration takes is of interest i.e., the software development
          cycle. An relatedly, how that works in terms of workflow management.

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">

            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Working productively and safely: I will be putting in place a
          structure to look after my wellbeing and work time. For example,
          spending an appropriate period each day / week looking after wellbeing
          and ensuring that I am similarly able to (timebox) each sprint
          appropriately. I will also be looking to ensure positive engagement
          with course learners and facilitators. For example, managing
          extraneous communications and engaging fully where needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          When things are building up: As above, I am also wanting to ensure
          that my wellbeing is looked after. I have the opportunity to do that
          working from home and on a hybrid basis. And getting needed exercise
          and sleep!
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For Dev Academy course matters, I will seek assistance from my
          Facilitator, in the first instance. And reach out to fellow learners
          and facilitators when I am struggling with course-related materials.
          At home, my partner Sara, is the go to person!

          I expect clear and timely communications from the Facilitation team on
          what’s needed for the course, whether that is through the Student
          Handbook, or through other direct communications. Although the course
          is self-directed, it is still crucial to know the course direction and
          requirements. Similar clear and timely communications where help is
          needed on a course problem (tech or human skills). And importantly,
          supporting a positive collaborative and productive learning
          environment for everyone.

        <p>
          I have mentioned previously that I appreciate the hybrid working
          model. And would like to ensure that it is maintained as much as
          possible. Currently, that means working from home on Wednesdays. When
          I also have family chores to look after.

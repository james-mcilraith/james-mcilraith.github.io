        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I am reasonably established in my long term goal or career pathway –
          as a social researcher working in government for the past decade. That
          is certainly something that I will be looking to build upon, in due
          course. This Dev Academy course opens up some new possibilities for me
          – to build my software development know-how alongside other
          transferable knowledge and skills from the course. That will hopefully
          support me to grow my social research career and also chart new
          directions in the software development field.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I am a keen and steady learner, especially when I am interested in and
          passionate about a subject. I have reasonably good ‘learning
          processes’, such as reading, note-taking, and time-management skills.
          Learning limitations might include software development currency,
          being side-tracked following up on subjects or by other tasks, and the
          busyness of everyday life. I would add that the tyranny of distance
          (from Ōtaki to Wellington) may also prove to be a learning limitation
          i.e., with the tiredness of commutes.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I think in non-technical / human skills, I am looking forward to
          working with others in the collaborative software space. Though it may
          prove challenging at times. The particular form that such
          collaboration takes is of interest i.e., the software development
          cycle. An relatedly, how that works in terms of workflow management.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Working productively and safely: I will be putting in place a
          structure to look after my wellbeing and work time. For example,
          spending an appropriate period each day / week looking after wellbeing
          and ensuring that I am similarly able to (timebox) each sprint
          appropriately. I will also be looking to ensure positive engagement
          with course learners and facilitators. For example, managing
          extraneous communications and engaging fully where needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          When things are building up: As above, I am also wanting to ensure
          that my wellbeing is looked after. I have the opportunity to do that
          working from home and on a hybrid basis. And getting needed exercise
          and sleep!
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely.
            way.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For Dev Academy course matters, I will seek assistance from my
          Facilitator, in the first instance. And reach out to fellow learners
          and facilitators when I am struggling with course-related materials.
          At home, my partner Sara, is the go to person!
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I expect clear and timely communications from the Facilitation team on
          what’s needed for the course, whether that is through the Student
          Handbook, or through other direct communications. Although the course
          is self-directed, it is still crucial to know the course direction and
          requirements. Similar clear and timely communications where help is
          needed on a course problem (tech or human skills). And importantly,
          supporting a positive collaborative and productive learning
          environment for everyone.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">

            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
            committed to other things.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I have mentioned previously that I appreciate the hybrid working
          model. And would like to ensure that it is maintained as much as
          possible. Currently, that means working from home on Wednesdays. When
          I also have family chores to look after.

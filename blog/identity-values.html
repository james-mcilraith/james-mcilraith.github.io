          E kī ana te kōrero: Whāia te mātauranga hei oranga mō koutou. Let me
          begin with a proverb: Seek after learning for the sake of your
          wellbeing.

        <h5>Blog post questions</h5>
        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
            how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As a social researcher I’ve often been involved in considering and making
          ethical decision in relation to research, evaluation, and data. One
          such instance involved research ethics at the Ministry where I worked
          and regularly making ethical (review) decisions about or on internal
          Ministry studies and external request made by academics and
          researchers to carry out research or evaluation with our Ministry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The values involved in those decisions are usually quite
          straightforward. Key ethical principles for example, including
          respect, benefit, and justice. They had to align in this regard with
          good research practice and standards, including having institutional
          ethics approval and being well-designed. They also needed to accord
          with the Ministry’s vision and values. And importantly, broadly
          support the mana and improved wellbeing of tamariki and whānau in
          Aotearoa New Zealand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although quite straightforward there were at times competing values
          and operational considerations that meant deeper consideration and
          consultation was required. For example, although the research design
          may not have been as best possible it was still an important area of
          inquiry. Or, although an important area of inquiry, possible harms or
          operational impacts meant we couldn’t proceed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notably, myself and others in the group, making these decisions,
          frequently carried out wide-ranging consultations with interested
          parties, and bought to considerations expertise in good research
          practice and standards, in an effort to be comprehensive and
          evenhanded. And reconcile any competing values and concerns. For me
          the key value of fairness was crucial in arriving at a decision.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
            your values and identity.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The value of fairness is one that has always been central to the way I
          work and interact with others. Whether is reflecting on whether I am
          being fair or seeing or encouraging it in other actions. This
          particularly comes from my family and particularly my mother who was
          always assiduous in ensuring fairness when we were growing up. I think
          at heart this is where my central values come from and from where I
          continue to muster resilience.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
            learning journey.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Interestingly, for the Big 5 Markers that assess five major dimensions
          of personality – my raw scores show that I am strongest in
          intellect/imagination, followed by conscientiousness, agreeableness,
          emotional stability, and lastly extraversion. Conversely, compared to
          others, my percentile score shows that I am strongest in emotional
          stability (87th percentile), followed by conscientiousness (84th
          percentile), intellect/imagination (80th percentile), agreeableness
          (57th percentile), and lastly extraversion (42nd percentile).
        </p>
        <p>
          This matches up somewhat with comments that I have received in the
          past about my strengths. For instance, comments such as helpful,
          supportive, solution-focused, and thoughtful. And extensive work
          managing research projects in collaboration with others and mentoring
          staff. I would most probably suggest in relation to the Big 5 then
          that I am stronger in agreeableness. But agree that I am more of an
          ambivert that more of an introvert or extravert.This matches up

          Intellect/imagination is also known in the literature as Openness to
          Experience. People who score high on this are characterised as being
          imaginative, curious, and open to new ideas and experiences. People
          who score high on emotional stability are characterised as being
          emotionally resilient, calm, and even-tempered.

          I hope that these two stronger areas, as indeed strengths in other
          areas, would especially support my engagement in this Dev Academy /
          fill stack development learning journey. And support steady
          involvement and perseverance in the course and its collaborations.

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?

        </ul>
        <p>
          In terms of my effective learning and project work, I am most probably in the top percentile for procrastination and thoroughness. I can be easily distracted at times and taken off task and can spend too much time looking for answers and trying to get things ‘just right’. This can affect the timelines of results and doing enough for what is needed aka. fit-for-purpose or a MVP. 
        </p>
        <p>This is something that I will have to keep a watch on to make sure that I complete assessments and tasks successfully. Ensuring that, as I am responsible for my learning journey, and that much of it is working at home, I have in place my own and the key suggested structures e.g., task-orientation and time boxing.</p>
     
        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are most probably several good examples where collegial working needed to be changed-up to ensure the project and collaboration were more productive. I am thinking of one especially where there were innumerable changes to the project brief, lack of openness and sharing on the part of the project team, and conversely excessive (unnecessary) communications.</p>
<p>As project lead for our team, the first step was to try and ensure we had a clear project brief, and that our own (research and evaluation) planning documents were clear and approved. The intention being to know what the project was about, what we were expected to do, and what we planned to do. This then received clear senior approval. We also sought to discuss sharing of key planning materials and bring communications into more appropriate and timed channels e.g., regular meetings.</p>
<p>This was partially successful. We were able to clearly orientate the part we were playing in the project. However, couldn’t get a sufficient understanding on the project itself, partially because things were very changeable, and it remained difficult to improve communications with the project team. This was perhaps representative of their overall project team culture.</p>
<p>The first strategy I would try now is to avoid being involved in the project. If it were unavoidable, I would be looking to tighten things even more in terms of what could be controlled on our side of the project and our contribution i.e., limit it to fit-for-purpose. There is also the potential for having some further ‘ways of working’ conversations to better match communication and working patterns.</p>

        <h2>Problem solving!</h2>
        <h4>Thursday, 19 September 2024</h4>
        <p>
          This technical blog recalls a time when I was blocked on a simple
          problem, solved a problem, problem-solving techniques/processes, and
          asking for help.
        </p>
        <h5>What was that simple problem?</h5>
        <p>
          The last time I was blocked on what turned out to be a simple problem
          was during the JavaScipt Kata section of Sprint 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem: the NPM test wasn’t running as it should… or so I
          thought. It was saying each of the test lines for answers was being
          skipped. It turns out that the NPM test was running correctly. And I
          had just missed a section of the readme file, skimmed over it too
          quickly, or forgotten it from the previous day.
        </p>
        <p>
          My problem-solving technique was rudimentary. My first thought at the
          time was that it was supposed to look that way and if I kept working
          through the challenges, they would all eventually turn up green ticks
          (or red crosses). This was a faulty assumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was quite late when the problem arose on the sixth section of the
          Kata challenge (JS Olympics). I had been engrossed in the Kata
          challenge and really didn’t look around sufficiently as it was late. I
          forgot all my usual practices of looking back over the (full)
          guidance. Including the readme file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I did look over the student handbook again, I thought it best
          to just reach out through the Discord ‘help-desk’ channel for help as
          it seemed I was unlikely to resolve it. Here the problem was quickly
          sorted and I continued with green ticks now presenting (occasionally).
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt a little ‘out of the loop’ and like I was missing something,
          but really couldn’t point to how I might answer it given the format.
          And after looking at my usual first place for answers, Google.
          Reaching out after that seemed the best option.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learnt that in the first instance I should really stick with best
          practice and look at the readme file properly! And the other guidance.
          And return to them if I’ve missed something.
        </p>

        <h5>When did you elegantly solve a problem?</h5>
        <p>
          I don’t think I am at the stage yet of feeling like I am elegantly
          solving any of the problems. More like solving them with perseverance
          and late hours (and written scribbles).
        </p>
        <p>
          Having said that there have been several instances when I have applied
          things I’ve learnt to a subsequent problem, and it has resolved the
          problem or been close to it in the first instance (before I had to
          return to being perseverant).
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem-solving techniques that I am especially relying on include
          pseudo coding scribbles, breaking problems down, and checking or
          confirming the code or logic online (sometimes where I have seen the
          problems before).
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt positive about this applied learning process, that my own
          knowledge and skills are developing, and of course, finding the
          solution to the problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learnt that inherent workflow processes are useful to helping find
          elegant solutions. And by workflow processes, I include GitHub formal
          ones, and beyond, to other tangible and intangible processes that we
          are learning about, such as console.logging, pseudo coding, and the
          rubber ducky method.
        </p>

        <h5>
          How confident do you feel using each of these problem-solving
          techniques/processes?
        </h5>
        <p>
          My confidence level given on a 1-5 scale (for beginners), with 1 being
          ‘not very good’ and 5 being ‘very good’. With comments alongside.
        </p>

        <ul class="list" style="list-style: circle">
          <li>
            <b>Pseudocode:</b> Rating = 2. I am still learning to take advantage
            of and utilise pseudocode properly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Trying something:</b> Rating = 4. Really that’s the best thing to
            do. Particularly in a live code testing environment. It can be
            frustrating though when you try something slightly differently 50
            times. Or worse the same thing 50 times. Bliss when on the 51st time
            it all seems to work with just a minor tweak.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Rubber ducky method:</b> Rating = 4. I talk to myself all the
            time. I just need the rubber ducky.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reading error messages:</b> Rating = 2. I am still getting to
            grips with what error messages mean. Relying on Google for
            elaboration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Console.logging:</b> Rating = 3. Similar to pseudocode and
            reading error messages I am still learning about and how best to use
            console.logging. I am having some genuine realisations when I do use
            it to good effect. It is just the knowing how and when that I am
            still working on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Googling:</b> Rating = 5. Google and I are old friends. And I am
            a regular google searcher for coding solutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Asking your peers for help:</b> Rating = 1. I tend to want to dig
            into the problem first before reaching out for help. And we are
            still getting to know fellow ākonga.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Asking coaches for help:</b> Rating = 3. A little better. As
            mentioned, I want to investigate the problem and most probably spend
            too much time doing that before heading over to the Discord
            ‘help-desk’ channel for assistance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Improving your process with reflection:</b> Rating = 4. I am
            fairly good at reflecting on a problem or my own process(es). The
            only challenge being taking the time to do so and then of course
            following up on what insights as a result of the reflection e.g., if
            it highlighted the need for further reading on a coding problem.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Plenty of areas for improvement in terms of workflow and being able to
          best use each of these problem-solving techniques/processes in a
          balanced and more complete way.
        </p>

        <h5>
          When were you reluctant to ask for help? Consider what made you
          reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
        </h5>
        <p>
          The last time I was reluctant to ask for help was for the mentioned
          NPM test saying [skipped]. And in hindsight, that it would have been
          useful to read the relevant readme file. I considered after a time
          trying to understand and sort out the problem to check with the
          Discord ‘help-desk’ channel. However, by that time it was late and I
          decided to wait until the morning. I did and the problem was resolved.
          Although I think this was more about ‘time of day reluctance’ than
          ‘general reluctance’ it does speak to my preference to exhaust other
          options first, when it is more preferable to reach out earlier (rather
          than get yourself into an unnecessary bind). Certainly, I am now
          encouraged to reach out earlier, when needed.

        <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h4>Monday, 15 September 2024</h4>
        <p>
          This blog puts some thought into neuroplasticity and the growth
          mindset. And how that understanding might blend with my learning plan
          and strategies.
        </p>
        <h5>Resaerch neuroplasticity</h5>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
            people.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity simply refers the brain's capacity to continue growing
          and evolving in response to life experiences. There are two main
          neuroplasticity types:
        </p>
        <ul class="list" style="list-style: circle">
          <li>
            <b>Functional neuroplasticity:</b> This relates to the permanent
            structural changes in neural synapses. It's brought on by
            development and learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Structural neuroplasticity:</b> This relates to the strength of
            the connections between neurons and changes to this strength.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity can have a positive effect: It means that it is
          possible to change unhealthy behavior and thinking patterns – to
          develop new abilities, skills, memories, and mindsets. Importantly, it
          can also let you recover from traumatic brain injury.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
            for your benefit.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are most probably a few key neuroplasticity benefits that I
          would think particularly applicable:
        </p>
        <ul class="list" style="list-style: circle">
          <li>It encourages learning and the needed learning effort.</li>
          <li>
            It helps you think about what supports improved neuroplasticity
            e.g., diet, exercise, environment, meditation, and sleep.
          </li>
          <li>
            It ultimately helps learning by increasing brain connections and
            memory.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This would be useful to apply during this learning period – knowing
          that the attitude and supports and the Dev Academy learning process
          contribute to and allow for improved (neuroplasticity) outcomes.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you look up the “principles of neuroplasticity” the top results
          suggest there are at several key principles. These are my favourites
          in terms of what contributes to people’s neuroplasticity:
        </p>
        <ul class="list" style="list-style: circle">
          <li>
            <b>Use it or lose it:</b> You have to keep on using specific brain
            functions or it can lead to loss of abilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Use it and improve it:</b> If you carry out training that drives
            a specific brain function it can lead to improving your abilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Specificity:</b> The kind of the training experience determines
            the nature of the change in the brain (neuroplasticity).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Repetition matters:</b> Change (neuroplasticity) requires enough
            repetition.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Intensity matters:</b> Change (neuroplasticity) requires rigorous
            training.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Time matters:</b> Different forms of change (neuroplasticity) in
            the brain happen at different times during training.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Salience matters:</b> The training experience must be meaningful
            to the person for it to cause change (neuroplasticity).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My least favourite refers to age – that change from training occurs
          more easily in younger brains! Needless to say, all these points speak
          to the importance of deliberately engaging with learning and that with
          the effort comes positive change.

        <h5>Resaerch growth mindset</h5>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Professor Carol Dweck talks about the growth mindset this way:
        </p>

        <div>
          <blockquote
            cite="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means">
            <p>
            Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts) 
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote><p>- Dweck, 2016</p></blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>Dweck also notes that <q>everyone is actually a mixture of fixed and growth mindsets, and that mixture continually evolves with experience.</q> Noting this what are some of the signs of a positive growth mindset (or characteristics you should encourage)?</p>
        <ul class="list" style="list-style: circle">
          <li>
            <b>Embrace challenges:</b> See challenges as opportunities to learn and grow. You welcome the chance to stretch yourself and develop new skills.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Be open-minded:</b> Be open to new ideas and viewpoints. You seek out feedback and constructive criticism, and you use it to improve and grow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Be persistent:</b> Put in the time and effort necessary to achieve your goals. You are not afraid of hard work and keep on going even when the going gets tough.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Embrace failure:</b> Understand that failure is an inherent part of the learning process. You aren’t discouraged by setbacks. Instead, you view them as opportunities to learn, grow, and improve.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Recognise effort:</b> Believe that effort and hard work together are crucial. You don't think that intelligence or natural talent alone are enough to achieve your goals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Learn from others:</b> Value the knowledge and expertise of others and are willing to learn from them. You are not afraid to ask questions and seek out guidance from others who can help you grow.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
          </li>
        </ul>
          <p>I think the thing that is crucial to recognise is that we are a mixture of both fixed and growth mindsets. And that we should strive to be more growth orientated, where possible. Also, that encouraging a growth mindset has to involve some quite practical steps – such as leaning into challenges and embracing failure as a learning opportunity. It is more than just having a positive outlook.</p>
      
        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
          </li>
         </ul>
        <p>Hopefully, I am already some way there – leaning into the challenge of full stack development and the necessities that involves i.e., study and assessments etc. Having said that, the growth mindset also encourages the key learning steps outlined above e.g., challenges, open-mindedness, persistence etc.</p>

        <h5>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h5>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        I think these are useful concepts to be aware of and practices to implement, where possible. Simply knowing about neuroplasticity is empowering, as is knowing about the growth mindset. Empowering, in the sense that it provides insights and opportunity to takes steps that support learning and positive change. These understandings will reinforce much of what I am familiar with and many of the steps that I have taken to date. And I think will contribute to a more nuanced learning plan and strategy.

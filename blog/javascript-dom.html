        <h2>JavaScript Fundamentals</h2>
        <h4>Thursday, 12 September 2024</h4>
        <p>
          This endeavors to be a non-technical blog post about JavaScript (JS)
          fundamentals. Answering the questions below as if talking to a friend
          who wants to learn more about these concepts. Code examples and
          diagrams are provided.

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">

            An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and
            CSS.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          One of the most apt analogies that I have seen to describe JavaScript
          and its relationship to HTML and CSS is a building. And if you were to
          imagine a web page as a building or house. HTML would be the building
          timbers - the framing of the house, including its floors, walls, and
          roof - providing the building structure. CSS would be the building
          styling. Perhaps the architraves, skirting, and paintwork, alongside
          all the interior and exterior decorations. Finally, JS would be the
          (often) hidden parts of the building. The house heating, plumbing,
          technology, and wiring. Making it run in interactive and functional
          ways.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            Explain control flow and loops using an example process from
            everyday life.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The default control flow for JS code is from top to bottom
          (line-by-line) - the order in which the individual statements,
          instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The control flow can be changed by conditional statements, loops, and
          function calls (see question 5 for more details about function calls).
          Changing the control flow of our JS code helps make web pages even
          more dynamic, interactive, and powerful.
        </p>
        <p>
          What are conditional statements, loops, and function calls that
          regulate the JS code?
        </p>
        <ul class="list" style="list-style: circle">
          <li>
            <b>Conditional statements:</b> Conditional statements regulate JS
            code behavior. They determine whether pieces of code can run (or are
            skipped).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Loops:</b> Loop are JS code that is used to repeat a set of
            instructions. For example, if you wanted to run the same code
            repeatedly, each time with a different value. They continue until
            certain conditions are met.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Function calls:</b> Functions first involve a definition.
            However, to be executed the function needs to be involved. This is
            often described a <q>calling a function</q> (or a function call).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We can think of control flows – conditional statements, loops, and
          function calls – as akin to a coaching session on the football field.
          The JS code being like the coach and the players. With the conditional
          statements, loops, and function calls being the various calls made by
          the coach as the players go through their exercises and drills.
          Choosing to some and not others; repeating some until they are done
          well; and overall going through and reflecting on the coaching
          session.

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">

            Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact
            with it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the
          objects that comprise the web document content and structure. It is a programming interface (API) that espresents the HTML document as a tree of nodes. JS can
          interact with the DOM changing text and styles. It can also add new
          elements on the go, making web pages more dynamic and interactive. JS
          can listen for a mouse click on a button for instance, and following
          that event, react, and display for example, a message or change an
          image.

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and
            objects.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Arrays and objects are two different ways of classifying, structuring,
          and returning data. Objects are notably a powerful JS data type as
          they are used in almost everything. For example, Functions, Arrays,
          and Regular Expression are objects. Objects themselves are also
          objects.
        </p>
        <ul class="list" style="list-style: circle">
          <li>
            <b>Arrays:</b> Are a collection of data and a data structure that is
            stored in a location sequence. Arrays are a special type of objects.
            They are especially useful when creating ordered collections where
            items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position
            in the list. Arrays are zero based. They can be accessed by calling
            the index number such as 0, 1, 2, 3, … e.g., array[0].
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Objects:</b> Are made up of a collection of properties. These
            properties include a name (or key) and a value. They represent a
            <q>characteristics of something</q> in JS code. That could be a
            person, a building, a book, or a game character – anything that
            comprises or can be defined by a set of characteristics. The
            properties of an object can be called by using dot notation e.g.,
            object.property or bracket notation e.g., object['property'].
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A JS function is like a procedure – a set of statements that performs
          a task or calculates a value. Functions remove the need for repeating
          the same code. For it to be a function it should take some input and
          return an output where there is a relationship between the input and
          output. The code inside the function is executed when it is called.
          Functions are a fundamental JS building block.

        <h2>Foundations reflection</h2>
        <h4>Friday, 27 September 2024</h4>
        <p>
          This human skills blog asks for Foundations reflection. About things
          learnt, the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning,
          and surprising things learnt during Foundations. It also touches on
          challenges and the importance of human skills.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
            ego due to the Human Skills learning?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          What I’ve learnt about myself is mostly in relation to what’s new -
          what we have been learning about and how that has impacted me and
          influenced my ego.
        </p>
        <ol class="list-no">
          <li>
            I’ve learned, or had it reinforced that the more I learn about
            software development, the more I realise that there is so much more
            to learn (or that I don’t know about). That learning realisation is
            always refreshingly humbling for the ego.
          </li>
          <li>
            I’ve learned that I am enjoying being critically engaged with new
            knowledge and skills, which is a rewarding place to be when starting
            out learning. My ego worries that the forthcoming bootcamp
            challenge, which is be even more fast-paced, may prove difficult for
            my more gradual learning style.
          </li>
          <li>
            I’ve learned, or had it reinforced that my natural chronological
            clock much prefers working a little later into the evening when my
            mind seems to be more focused. This is rather tragic for my ‘make
            the most of an early morning’ ego, as it means I end up going to bed
            later and often getting up a little later. That must, of course,
            change for bootcamp!
          </li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
            and programming?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Values, empathy, and self-awareness are interconnected and play an
          important part in how you approach learning and programming. And grow
          as a person and in relation to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Values speak to the principles that guide your thinking and actions.
          They reflect what is important to you. And can guide you in your
          day-to-day interactions and behaviours – as you learn and work
          together coding for example, supporting one another and building a
          body of human and programming knowledge and skills. Importantly, they
          also help guide those big picture conversations around what ‘we’ are
          doing and how ‘we’ are doing it. For instance, helping to answer, or
          at least provide some direction, on common ethical and privacy issues
          in software development, data collection and use, and in today’s
          context, around the employment and further development of AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empathy is a particularly critical ingredient in developing
          connections and building relationships. Understanding and sharing the
          insights and feelings of others. And one that is helpful in any group
          or social situation, particularly where social connection and
          collaboration are important, and where there are everyday stresses and
          project or work-related anxieties. This may include in a programming
          learning environment, with lessons and assessments challenging folks,
          alongside providing learning opportunities and excitement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-awareness is perhaps one of the most important factors in
          someone’s own journey – being able to look at and reflect upon your
          own thoughts and behaviours. Where your strengths and weaknesses
          reside and how you can improve upon your development and wellbeing.
          Self-awareness, or lack of, affects you and others. Without
          self-awareness you are less likely to be able to challenge yourself to
          change and improve. This in both a behavioural and practical sense –
          how you better work with others for example, or how you learn and
          apply yourself to coding projects.

          <li>
            What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I’ve thoroughly enjoyed writing the blogs. I suppose this has
          surprised me a little coming from a social research background where I
          have been similarly engaged with human skills challenges and some of
          the topics. Perhaps it shouldn’t have surprised me! I think it is the
          blog writing itself and the format that I’ve enjoyed.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I think, as some other may have experienced, that expressing your
          ideas – really reflecting on your own knowledge, skills, and person -
          is sometimes challenging. And doing so in a manner that is kind and
          respectful to yourself and the reader. Trying to reflect on things in
          a way that is also helpful to yourself and for the reader (where there
          were associated blog posts). I think the blogging itself is a useful
          challenging exercise i.e., as a journalling process.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
            focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
            course?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Having been in the workplace for several years I support the
          importance of human skills. And that in most instances it is more
          important to hire someone who has good human skills (a good EQ) with
          great potential. Being able to work with others, get along well, and
          develop with the team are crucial. They make the difference.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-ni" style="list-style: square">
          <li>
            Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel
            like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
            practice programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I agree that human skills are vitally important. And don’t think it is
          a waste of time. In this training space, that learning just needs to
          be balanced appropriately with the technical ones. And that may be
          differing for different people given for example, peoples different
          backgrounds, experience, and learning requirements.
